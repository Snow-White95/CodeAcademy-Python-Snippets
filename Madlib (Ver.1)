print """Once upon a time there was a prince named %s who wanted to marry a %s,
but she would have to be a real %s. He %s all over the world to find one, 
but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were %s enough, but it was 
difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something 
about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, 
for he would have liked very much to have a real %s.
One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, 
and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the 
city gate, and the old king went to open it.
It was a %s standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! 
what a sight the rain and the wind had made %s look. The water ran down from 
%s hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of %s shoes and out again at 
the heels. And yet she said that she was a real %s.""" %(noun2, noun1, noun1, past_verb, noun1, noun1, noun1, pronoun, pronoun, pronoun, noun1)
